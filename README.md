![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a38562a2-0a0f-4ce2-8b5c-f0d40fb943b9)



## Description
Our vision is to democratize real estate investment by allowing individuals to participate in fractional property ownership through a secure and transparent blockchain platform. This smart contract empowers investors to purchase shares in properties, receive dividends, and participate in governance decisions, all while ensuring security and fairness through Ethereum-based smart contracts.

## Project Overview
The Fractional Property Investment smart contract enables property owners to tokenize their real estate assets into shares that investors can purchase. Investors earn dividends based on their share ownership and can participate in governance through voting on proposals related to the management of the properties.
